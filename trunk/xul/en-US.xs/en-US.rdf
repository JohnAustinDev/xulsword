                   BOOKMARKS:VerseText="Now there was a man of the Pharisees named  Nicodemus,  a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus  by night and said to him,  Rabbi,  we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do  unless God is with him. Jesus answered him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is  born  again he cannot  see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born? Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born  of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.  That which is born of the flesh is  flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born  again.  The wind blows  where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.    Nicodemus said to him,  How can these things be? Jesus answered him, Are you the teacher of Israel  and yet you do not understand these things? Truly, truly, I say to you,  we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but  you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?  No one has  ascended into heaven except  he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And  as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man  be lifted up, that whoever believes  in him  may have eternal life.      For  God so loved  the world,  that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not  perish but have eternal life. For  God did not send his Son into the world  to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.  Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not  believed in the name of the only Son of God.  And this is the judgment:  the light has come into the world, and  people loved the darkness rather than the light because  their deeds were evil.  For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light,  lest his deeds should be exposed. "
