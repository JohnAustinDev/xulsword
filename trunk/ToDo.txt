Version 3.5 release ToDos:

Bugs to fix before release:
DONE!: Exception reporter isn't working
WON'T DO (to many complcations): Use SWORD Locale for book list and book names, rather than internal list
DONE!: Print feature prints blank page
DONE! (caused by removal of XR dlls!): Firefox 17 bug causes locale extension to fail: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/toolkit/mozapps/extensions/XPIProvider.jsm.html line 860
DONE!: Window's UI font size is HUGE- reduce it

ON LINUX:
DONE!: Look at multi-column Bible view chapter looping problem.

DONE!: AGL introductions with RTL interface does not display correct text-alignment.

DONE!: Test and fix startup scenarios: No-modules->install-non-Bible-mod->install-Bible-mod. No-LibSword->????. First-time-startup.

DONE!: Check bookmark module styles, figure out styles for user-text and boomark names (use isASCII?).

DONE!: (revisit when new Module Manager is added) Consider carefully the newModule.js flow: blocking vs. non-blocking: what does it really mean?

DONE!: Look at pinned GenBook text functionality, esp. with windowed viewports.

DONE!: Complete IBT locales: en-US,kum,ky,ky-ar,ru,tt,uz,uz-lat

Do a thorough use-test of all program corners needed by IBT release.


ON WINDOWS:
DONE!: Compile for Windows and update Windows installer.

WON'T DO (Windows Firefox still doesn't run XUL apps directly as yet): Assemble new Windows-programs using FireFox-Portable instead of XulRunner

Do a thorough use-test of all program corners on Windows, including Windows-8. Especially test locale installation and uninstallation.

Upload MK 3.5 to IBT along with modules having udpated UIs.

Update the xulsword website with version 3.5 changes in mind.

FIXES FOR LATER:
Linux and Windows builds should include swordMK .cpp files the same way.
Linux static library script needs to handle security based on ./configure
