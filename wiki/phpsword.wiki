Server Side SWORD

= phpsword PECL extension =

This PHP extension brings the power of SWORD to a web server. It provides the same API that xulsword utilizes, but via PHP, rather than Javascript.


= Compilation and use =

Compile the extension by going to the phpsword directory and running:
{{{
$ phpize
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
}}}

This will install the extension to your php shared extensions directory.

Next, to enable the extension you can add the following to your php.ini:
{{{
[PHP]
extension=phpsword.so
}}}
And then restart PHP:
{{{
$ sudo apache2ctl restart
}}}

Finally, to access phpsword from PHP, do something like this:
{{{
if (!extension_loaded("phpsword")) {
  header('Location: ' . $redirect_URL);
  exit;
}

$Sword = new phpsword($repository_path);

$My_modlist = $Sword->getModuleList();
}}}

The PHP interface is the same as the [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/xul/content/libsword.js Javascript interface].
