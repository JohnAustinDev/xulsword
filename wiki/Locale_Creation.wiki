=Create a new user interface locale for xulsword=

===What must be translated?===
The phrases of xulsword's user interface are found in [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/en-US/UI-en-US.txt this file].

===Add a new locale to xulsword===
Locales are automatically packaged when xulsword is built. Place the new [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/#localeDev%2Fen-US locale files] under a directory somewhere called `localeDev`. Then configure the [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/build/build_settings.txt build settings file] by setting the `IncludeLocales` parameter to include the new locale's ISO code, and by setting `XulswordExtras` to the path of your `localeDev`'s parent directory. Rebuild and start xulsword.

A new user interface choice will appear in the `Options` -> `Language` menu of xulsword. Also, a locale extension module will be created under `build-out` which can be used to install the new locale into other compatible versions of xulsword.

===Optional user interface possibilities===
  * Many optional locale configuration settings are found in [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/en-US/UI-en-US_2.txt this file] including the order of Bible books, short-cut keys for menu commands, CSS font-family, font-size, etc., and localization of numerals and search symbols, among other things. 
  * A `locale-files` subdirectory, containing a localized splash image called [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/en-US/locale-files splash-overlay.png] may be included.
  * A `skin-files` subdirectory, containing files which will overwrite the default skin, may also be included. This allows you to run xulsword with a customized skin for your locale.
  * Some scripts (like Arabic), which cannot simply be printed vertically, will need images for vertical texts. These images should be placed under the `locale-files` subdirectory.
