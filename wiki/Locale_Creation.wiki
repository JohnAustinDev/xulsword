=Create a new user interface locale for xulsword=

===What must be translated?===
The phrases of xulsword's user interface are found in [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/en-US/UI-en-US.txt this file].

===Let Firefox translate xulsword for you===
There is a [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/UI-listing.pl perl script] which takes a Firefox locale in some language and creates a partially completed xulsword user interface in that language.

===Add a new locale to xulsword===
Locales are automatically packaged when xulsword is built. Place the new [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/#localeDev%2Fen-US locale files] under a directory somewhere called `localeDev`. Then update the [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/build/build_settings.txt build settings file] by adding the code of the new locale to `IncludeLocales`, and assign the path of your new `localeDev` parent directory to `XulswordExtras`. Rebuild and start xulsword. A new user interface choice will appear in the `Options` -> `Language` menu of xulsword.

===Checklist for finishing a new user interface locale===
  * Many optional locale configuration settings are found in [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/en-US/UI-en-US_2.txt this file] including the order of Bible books, short-cut keys for menu commands, CSS font-family, font-size, etc., and localization of numerals and search symbols, among other things. 
  * Include a [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/#localeDev%2Fen-US%2Flocale-files localized splash screen] (required).
  * Include [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/localeDev/en-US/en-US.rdf localized bookmarks] (optional).
  * Add a `skin-files` subdirectory (optional) containing files which will overwrite the default skin. This can be used to provide your locale with a custom skin. 
  * Some scripts (like Arabic), which cannot simply be printed vertically, will need images for vertical texts. These images should be placed under a `skin-files` directory.
