=Compilation instructions for MS-Windows=

== Build requirements ==
The following programs need to be in your command path:
  * [http://www.7-zip.org/download.html 7-zip] (command line version)
  * [http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/ Perl]
  * [http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Other-Programming-Files/Microsoft-Visual-C-Toolkit.shtml MSVC8 C++ Compiler] (the Express Edition works great)
  * [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0baf2b35-c656-4969-ace8-e4c0c0716adb&displaylang=en Windows SDK]. Old SDK versions like [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6510 Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK] work just fine. For quickest install, use the web-install and choose what parts you want to download. All that is required to build xulsword is the `Include` and `Lib` subdirectories. 

-----

== Compilation Steps ==
  # Checkout the xulsword code from https://xulsword.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/.
  # Unzip [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XULRunner the xulrunner runtime].
  # Unzip [http://sourceforge.net/projects/clucene/files/clucene-core-stable/0.9.21b/ Clucene-core 0.9.21b].
  # Unzip [http://www.crosswire.org/ftpmirror/pub/sword/source/v1.7 sword-1.7].
  # Update the paths and settings in the [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/build/build_settings.txt build settings file].
  # Run [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/build/build.pl build.pl].
  # Start the program by running `run-xulsword-dev.pl` (which is created when you build xulsword). The development version of the program has a hidden button which displays useful debugging features when clicked. This invisible button is located JUST under the top menu bar at the FAR right of the xulsword window. Debugging buttons will appear in that same area when the invisible button is clicked.

-----

==Build Controls==
Build controls are in [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/build/build_settings.txt build_settings.txt]. Build the Development version, Portable version, Firefox extension, and Setup installer version by setting their values to "true". Install modules with your build by adding your repository path(s) and by adding SWORD module names to the `IncludeModules` line. Various user preferences can be set [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/source/browse/trunk/build/build_prefs.txt here] as well.

-----

==Security Module==
To help protect texts from tampering, a security module is provided. To use the security module, set `UseSecurityModule` to true and set the path of `KeyGenPath` to your key generator.
